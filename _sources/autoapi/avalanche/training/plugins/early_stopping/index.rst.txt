   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   Base class for strategy plugins. Implements all the callbacks required
   by the BaseStrategy with an empty function. Subclasses must override
   the callbacks.

   Simple plugin stopping the training when the accuracy on the
   corresponding validation metric stopped progressing for a few epochs.
   The state of the best model is saved after each improvement on the
   given metric and is loaded back into the model before stopping the
   training procedure.

   :param patience: Number of epochs to wait before stopping the training.
   :param val_stream_name: Name of the validation stream to search in the
   metrics. The corresponding stream will be used to keep track of the
   evolution of the performance of a model.
   :param metric_name: The name of the metric to watch as it will be
   reported in the evaluator.
   :param mode: Must be "max" or "min". max (resp. min) means that the
   given metric should me maximized (resp. minimized).
