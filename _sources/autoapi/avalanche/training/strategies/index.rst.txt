   customized by adding plugins, which may be used to combine multiple basic
   strategies (e.g., EWC + replay).

.. py:class:: BaseStrategy(model: Module, optimizer: Optimizer, criterion, train_mb_size: int = 1, train_epochs: int = 1, eval_mb_size: int = 1, device='cpu', plugins: Optional[Sequence['StrategyPlugin']] = None, evaluator=default_logger, eval_every=-1)

   BaseStrategy is the super class of all task-based continual learning
   strategies. It implements a basic training loop and callback system
   that allows to execute code at each experience of the training loop.
   Plugins can be used to implement callbacks to augment the training
   loop with additional behavior (e.g. a memory buffer for replay).

   **Scenarios**
   This strategy supports several continual learning scenarios:

   * class-incremental scenarios (no task labels)
   * multi-task scenarios, where task labels are provided)
   * multi-incremental scenarios, where the same task may be revisited

   The exact scenario depends on the data stream and whether it provides
   the task labels.

   **Training loop**
   The training loop is organized as follows::
       train
           train_exp  # for each experience
               adapt_train_dataset
               train_dataset_adaptation
               make_train_dataloader
               train_epoch  # for each epoch
                   # forward
                   # backward
                   # model update

   **Evaluation loop**
   The evaluation loop is organized as follows::
       eval
           eval_exp  # for each experience
               adapt_eval_dataset
               eval_dataset_adaptation
               make_eval_dataloader
               eval_epoch  # for each epoch
                   # forward
                   # backward
