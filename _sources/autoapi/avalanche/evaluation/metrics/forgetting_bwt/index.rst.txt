.. py:class:: Forgetting

   Bases: :class:`Metric[Union[float, None, Dict[int, float]]]`

   The standalone Forgetting metric.
   This metric returns the forgetting relative to a specific key.
   Alternatively, this metric returns a dict in which each key is associated
   to the forgetting.
   Forgetting is computed as the difference between the first value recorded
   for a specific key and the last value recorded for that key.
   The value associated to a key can be update with the `update` method.

   At initialization, this metric returns an empty dictionary.

   Creates an instance of the standalone Forgetting metric

   .. attribute:: initial
      :annotation: :Dict[int, float]

      The initial value for each key.


   .. attribute:: last
      :annotation: :Dict[int, float]

      The last value detected for each key


   .. method:: update_initial(self, k, v)


   .. method:: update_last(self, k, v)


   .. method:: update(self, k, v, initial=False)


   .. method:: result(self, k=None) -> Union[float, None, Dict[int, float]]

      Forgetting is returned only for keys encountered twice.

      :param k: the key for which returning forgetting. If k has not
          updated at least twice it returns None. If k is None,
          forgetting will be returned for all keys encountered at least
          twice.

      :return: the difference between the first and last value encountered
          for k, if k is not None. It returns None if k has not been updated
          at least twice. If k is None, returns a dictionary
          containing keys whose value has been updated at least twice. The
          associated value is the difference between the first and last
          value recorded for that key.
