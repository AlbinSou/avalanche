.. py:class:: WeightCheckpoint

   Bases: :class:`PluginMetric[Tensor]`

   The WeightCheckpoint Metric. This is a standalone metric.

   Instances of this metric keeps the weight checkpoint tensor of the
   model at each experience. 

   Each time `result` is called, this metric emits the latest experience's
   weight checkpoint tensor since the last `reset`.

   The reset method will bring the metric to its initial state. By default
   this metric in its initial state will return None.

   Creates an instance of the WeightCheckpoint Metric.

   By default this metric in its initial state will return None.
   The metric can be updated by using the `update` method
   while the current experience's weight checkpoint tensor can be 
   retrieved using the `result` method.

   .. method:: update(self, weights) -> Tensor

      Update the weight checkpoint at the current experience.

      :param weights: the weight tensor at current experience
      :return: None.


   .. method:: result(self) -> Tensor

      Retrieves the weight checkpoint at the current experience.

      :return: The weight checkpoint as a tensor.


   .. method:: reset(self) -> None

      Resets the metric.

      :return: None.


   .. method:: after_eval_exp(self, strategy: BaseStrategy) -> 'MetricResult'

      Called after `eval_exp` by the `BaseStrategy`. 


   .. method:: __str__(self)

      Return str(self).
