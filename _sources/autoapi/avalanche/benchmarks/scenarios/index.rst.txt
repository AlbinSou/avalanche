.. py:class:: Experience

   Bases: :class:`Protocol[TScenario, TScenarioStream]`

   Definition of an experience. An experience contains a set of patterns
   which has become available at a particular time instant. The content and
   size of an Experience is defined by the specific benchmark that creates the
   IExperience instance.

   For instance, an experience of a New Classes scenario will contain all
   patterns belonging to a subset of classes of the original training set. An
   experience of a New Instance scenario will contain patterns from previously
   seen classes.

   Experiences of Single Incremental Task (a.k.a. task-free) scenarios are
   usually called "batches" while in Multi Task scenarios an Experience is
   usually associated to a "task". Finally, in a Multi Incremental Task
   scenario the Experience may be composed by patterns from different tasks.

   .. attribute:: origin_stream
      :annotation: :TScenarioStream

      A reference to the original stream from which this experience was obtained.


   .. attribute:: benchmark
      :annotation: :TScenario

      A reference to the benchmark.


   .. attribute:: current_experience
      :annotation: :int

      This is an incremental, 0-indexed, value used to keep track of the position 
      of current experience in the original stream.

      Beware that this value only describes the experience position in the 
      original stream and may be unrelated to the order in which the strategy will
      encounter experiences.


   .. attribute:: dataset
      :annotation: :AvalancheDataset

      The dataset containing the patterns available in this experience.


   .. method:: task_labels(self) -> List[int]
      :property:

      This list will contain the unique task labels of the patterns contained
      in this experience. In the most common scenarios this will be a list
      with a single value. Note: for scenarios that don't produce task labels,
      a placeholder task label value like 0 is usually set to each pattern
      (see the description of the originating scenario for details).


   .. method:: task_label(self) -> int
      :property:

      The task label. This value will never have value "None". However,
      for scenarios that don't produce task labels a placeholder value like 0
      is usually set. Beware that this field is meant as a shortcut to obtain
      a unique task label: it assumes that only patterns labeled with a
      single task label are present. If this experience contains patterns from
      multiple tasks, accessing this property will result in an exception.


   .. method:: scenario(self) -> TScenario
      :property:

      This property is DEPRECATED, use self.benchmark instead.



.. data:: TExperience
   

   

.. data:: TScenario
   

   

.. py:class:: ScenarioStream

   Bases: :class:`Protocol[TScenario, TExperience]`

   A scenario stream describes a sequence of incremental experiences.
   Experiences are described as :class:`IExperience` instances. They contain a
   set of patterns which has become available at a particular time instant
   along with any optional, scenario specific, metadata.

   Most scenario expose two different streams: the training stream and the test
   stream.

   .. attribute:: name
      :annotation: :str

      The name of the stream.


   .. attribute:: benchmark
      :annotation: :TScenario

      A reference to the scenario this stream belongs to.


   .. method:: scenario(self) -> TScenario
      :property:

      This property is DEPRECATED, use self.benchmark instead.


   .. method:: __getitem__(self: TScenarioStream, experience_idx: Union[int, slice, Iterable[int]]) -> Union[TExperience, TScenarioStream]

      Gets an experience given its experience index (or a stream slice given
      the experience order).

      :param experience_idx: An int describing the experience index or an
          iterable/slice object describing a slice of this stream.
      :return: The Experience instance associated to the given experience
          index or a sliced stream instance.


   .. method:: __len__(self) -> int

      Used to get the length of this stream (the amount of experiences).

      :return: The amount of experiences in this stream.



.. data:: TScenarioStream
   

   

.. py:class:: StreamUserDef

   Bases: :class:`typing.NamedTuple`

   Typed version of namedtuple.

   Usage in Python versions >= 3.6::

       class Employee(NamedTuple):
           name: str
           id: int

   This is equivalent to::

       Employee = collections.namedtuple('Employee', ['name', 'id'])

   The resulting class has an extra __annotations__ attribute, giving a
   dict that maps field names to types.  (The field names are also in
   the _fields attribute, which is part of the namedtuple API.)
   Alternative equivalent keyword syntax is also accepted::

       Employee = NamedTuple('Employee', name=str, id=int)

   In Python versions <= 3.5 use::

       Employee = NamedTuple('Employee', [('name', str), ('id', int)])

.. py:class:: GenericCLScenario(: TGenericCLScenario, *, stream_definitions: TStreamsUserDict, complete_test_set_only: bool = False, experience_factory: Callable[['GenericScenarioStream', int], TExperience] = None)

   Bases: :class:`Generic[TExperience]`

   Base implementation of a Continual Learning benchmark instance.
   A Continual Learning benchmark instance is defined by a set of streams of
   experiences (batches or tasks depending on the terminology). Each experience
   contains the training (or test, or validation, ...) data that becomes
   available at a certain time instant.

   Experiences are usually defined in children classes, with this class serving
   as the more general implementation. This class handles the most simple type
   of assignment: each stream is defined as a list of experiences, each
   experience is defined by a dataset.

   Defining the "train" and "test" streams is mandatory. This class supports
   custom streams as well. Custom streams can be accessed by using the
   `streamname_stream` field of the created instance.

   The name of custom streams can only contain letters, numbers or the "_"
   character and must not start with a number.

   Creates an instance of a Continual Learning benchmark instance.

   The benchmark instance is defined by a stream definition dictionary,
   which describes the content of each stream. The "train" and "test"
   stream are mandatory. Any other custom stream can be added.

   There is no constraint on the amount of experiences in each stream
   (excluding the case in which `complete_test_set_only` is set).

   :param stream_definitions: The stream definitions dictionary. Must
       be a dictionary where the key is the stream name and the value
       is the definition of that stream. "train" and "test" streams are
       mandatory. This class supports custom streams as well. The name of
       custom streams can only contain letters, numbers and the "_"
       character and must not start with a number. Streams can be defined
       is two ways: static and lazy. In the static case, the
       stream must be a tuple containing 1, 2 or 3 elements:
       - The first element must be a list containing the datasets
       describing each experience. Datasets must be instances of
       :class:`AvalancheDataset`.
       - The second element is optional and must be a list containing the
       task labels of each experience (as an int or a set of ints).
       If the stream definition tuple contains only one element (the list
       of datasets), then the task labels for each experience will be
       obtained by inspecting the content of the datasets.
       - The third element is optional and must be a reference to the
       originating dataset (if applicable). For instance, for SplitMNIST
       this may be a reference to the whole MNIST dataset. If the stream
       definition tuple contains less than 3 elements, then the reference
       to the original dataset will be set to None.
       In the lazy case, the stream must be defined as a tuple with 2
       elements:
       - The first element must be a tuple containing the dataset generator
       (one for each experience) and the number of experiences in that
       stream.
       - The second element must be a list containing the task labels of
       each experience (as an int or a set of ints).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, the test stream will contain
       a single experience containing the complete test set. This also
       means that the definition for the test stream must contain the
       definition for a single experience.
   :param experience_factory: If not None, a callable that, given the
       benchmark instance and the experience ID, returns a experience
       instance. This parameter is usually used in subclasses (when
       invoking the super constructor) to specialize the experience class.
       Defaults to None, which means that the :class:`GenericExperience`
       constructor will be used.

   .. attribute:: stream_definitions
      

      A structure containing the definition of the streams.


   .. attribute:: original_train_dataset
      :annotation: :Optional[Dataset]

      The original training set. May be None. 


   .. attribute:: original_test_dataset
      :annotation: :Optional[Dataset]

      The original test set. May be None. 


   .. attribute:: train_stream
      :annotation: :GenericScenarioStream[TExperience, TGenericCLScenario]

      The stream used to obtain the training experiences. 
      This stream can be sliced in order to obtain a subset of this stream.


   .. attribute:: test_stream
      :annotation: :GenericScenarioStream[TExperience, TGenericCLScenario]

      The stream used to obtain the test experiences. This stream can be 
      sliced in order to obtain a subset of this stream.

      Beware that, in certain scenarios, this stream may contain a single
      element. Check the ``complete_test_set_only`` field for more details.


   .. attribute:: complete_test_set_only
      :annotation: :bool

      If True, only the complete test set will be returned from experience
      instances.

      This flag is usually set to True in scenarios where having one separate
      test set aligned to each training experience is impossible or doesn't
      make sense from a semantic point of view.


   .. method:: streams(self) -> Dict[str, 'GenericScenarioStream[TExperience, TGenericCLScenario]']
      :property:


   .. method:: n_experiences(self) -> int
      :property:

      The number of incremental training experiences contained
      in the train stream. 


   .. method:: task_labels(self) -> Sequence[List[int]]
      :property:

      The task label of each training experience. 


   .. method:: get_reproducibility_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]

      Gets the data needed to reproduce this experiment.

      This data can be stored using the pickle module or some other mechanism.
      It can then be loaded by passing it as the ``reproducibility_data``
      parameter in the constructor.

      Child classes should create their own reproducibility dictionary.
      This means that the implementation found in :class:`GenericCLScenario`
      will return an empty dictionary, which is meaningless.

      In order to obtain the same benchmark instance, the reproducibility
      data must be passed to the constructor along with the exact same
      input datasets.

      :return: A dictionary containing the data needed to reproduce the
          experiment.


   .. method:: classes_in_experience(self) -> Mapping[str, Sequence[Optional[Set[int]]]]
      :property:

      A dictionary mapping each stream (by name) to a list.

      Each element of the list is a set describing the classes included in
      that experience (identified by its index).

      In previous releases this field contained the list of sets for the
      training stream (that is, there was no way to obtain the list for other
      streams). That behavior is deprecated and support for that usage way
      will be removed in the future.


   .. method:: get_classes_timeline(self, current_experience: int, stream: str = 'train')

      Returns the classes timeline given the ID of a experience.

      Given a experience ID, this method returns the classes in that
      experience, previously seen classes, the cumulative class list and a
      list of classes that will be encountered in next experiences of the
      same stream.

      Beware that by default this will obtain the timeline of an experience
      of the **training** stream. Use the stream parameter to select another
      stream.

      :param current_experience: The reference experience ID.
      :param stream: The stream name.
      :return: A tuple composed of four lists: the first list contains the
          IDs of classes in this experience, the second contains IDs of
          classes seen in previous experiences, the third returns a cumulative
          list of classes (that is, the union of the first two list) while the
          last one returns a list of classes that will be encountered in next
          experiences. Beware that each of these elements can be None when
          the benchmark is initialized by using a lazy generator.



.. py:class:: GenericScenarioStream(: TGenericScenarioStream, name: str, benchmark: TGenericCLScenario, *, slice_ids: List[int] = None)

   Bases: :class:`Generic[TExperience, TGenericCLScenario]`, :class:`ScenarioStream[TGenericCLScenario, TExperience]`, :class:`Sequence[TExperience]`

   A scenario stream describes a sequence of incremental experiences.
   Experiences are described as :class:`IExperience` instances. They contain a
   set of patterns which has become available at a particular time instant
   along with any optional, scenario specific, metadata.

   Most scenario expose two different streams: the training stream and the test
   stream.

   Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

   .. attribute:: slice_ids
      :annotation: :Optional[List[int]]

      Describes which experiences are contained in the current stream slice. 
      Can be None, which means that this object is the original stream. 


   .. attribute:: name
      :annotation: :str

      The name of the stream (for instance: "train", "test", "valid", ...).


   .. attribute:: benchmark
      

      A reference to the benchmark.


   .. method:: __len__(self) -> int

      Gets the number of experiences this stream it's made of.

      :return: The number of experiences in this stream.


   .. method:: __getitem__(self, exp_idx: Union[int, slice, Iterable[int]]) -> Union[TExperience, TScenarioStream]

      Gets a experience given its experience index (or a stream slice given
      the experience order).

      :param exp_idx: An int describing the experience index or an
          iterable/slice object describing a slice of this stream.

      :return: The experience instance associated to the given experience
          index or a sliced stream instance.


   .. method:: drop_previous_experiences(self, to_exp: int) -> None

      Drop the reference to experiences up to a certain experience ID
      (inclusive).

      This means that any reference to experiences with ID [0, from_exp] will
      be released. By dropping the reference to previous experiences, the
      memory associated with them can be freed, especially the one occupied by
      the dataset. However, if external references to the experience or the
      dataset still exist, dropping previous experiences at the stream level
      will have little to no impact on the memory usage.

      To make sure that the underlying dataset can be freed, make sure that:
      - No reference to previous datasets or experiences are kept in you code;
      - The replay implementation doesn't keep a reference to previous
          datasets (in which case, is better to store a copy of the raw
          tensors instead);
      - The benchmark is being generated using a lazy initializer.

      By dropping previous experiences, those experiences will no longer be
      available in the stream. Trying to access them will result in an
      exception.

      :param to_exp: The ID of the last exp to drop (inclusive). Can be a
          negative number, in which case this method doesn't have any effect.
          Can be greater or equal to the stream length, in which case all
          currently loaded experiences will be dropped.
      :return: None



.. py:class:: AbstractExperience(: TExperience, origin_stream: TScenarioStream, current_experience: int, classes_in_this_exp: Sequence[int], previous_classes: Sequence[int], classes_seen_so_far: Sequence[int], future_classes: Optional[Sequence[int]])

   Bases: :class:`Experience[TScenario, TScenarioStream]`, :class:`abc.ABC`

   Definition of a learning experience. A learning experience contains a set of
   patterns which has become available at a particular time instant. The
   content and size of an Experience is defined by the specific benchmark that
   creates the experience.

   For instance, an experience of a New Classes scenario will contain all
   patterns belonging to a subset of classes of the original training set. An
   experience of a New Instance scenario will contain patterns from previously
   seen classes.

   Creates an instance of the abstract experience given the benchmark
   stream, the current experience ID and data about the classes timeline.

   :param origin_stream: The stream from which this experience was
       obtained.
   :param current_experience: The current experience ID, as an integer.
   :param classes_in_this_exp: The list of classes in this experience.
   :param previous_classes: The list of classes in previous experiences.
   :param classes_seen_so_far: List of classes of current and previous
       experiences.
   :param future_classes: The list of classes of next experiences.

   .. attribute:: classes_in_this_experience
      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      The list of classes in this experience 


   .. attribute:: previous_classes
      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      The list of classes in previous experiences 


   .. attribute:: classes_seen_so_far
      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      List of classes of current and previous experiences 


   .. attribute:: future_classes
      :annotation: :Optional[Sequence[int]]

      The list of classes of next experiences 


   .. method:: task_label(self) -> int
      :property:

      The task label. This value will never have value "None". However,
      for scenarios that don't produce task labels a placeholder value like 0
      is usually set. Beware that this field is meant as a shortcut to obtain
      a unique task label: it assumes that only patterns labeled with a
      single task label are present. If this experience contains patterns from
      multiple tasks, accessing this property will result in an exception.



.. py:class:: GenericExperience(: TGenericExperience, origin_stream: GenericScenarioStream[TGenericExperience, TGenericCLScenario], current_experience: int)

   Bases: :class:`AbstractExperience[TGenericCLScenario, GenericScenarioStream[TGenericExperience, TGenericCLScenario]]`

   Definition of a learning experience based on a :class:`GenericCLScenario`
   instance.

   This experience implementation uses the generic experience-patterns
   assignment defined in the :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance. Instances of
   this class are usually obtained from a benchmark stream.

   Creates an instance of a generic experience given the stream from this
   experience was taken and and the current experience ID.

   :param origin_stream: The stream from which this experience was
       obtained.
   :param current_experience: The current experience ID, as an integer.

   This helper function is DEPRECATED in favor of
   `create_multi_dataset_generic_benchmark`.

   Creates a generic scenario given a list of datasets and the respective task
   labels. Each training dataset will be considered as a separate training
   experience. Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including the
   targets.

   When loading the datasets from a set of fixed filelist, consider using
   the :func:`create_generic_scenario_from_filelists` helper method instead.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list of test datsets that must
   contain the same amount of datasets of the training list.
   Those pairs are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   Beware that pattern transformations must already be included in the
   datasets (when needed).

   :param train_dataset_list: A list of training datasets.
   :param test_dataset_list: A list of test datasets.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_dataset_list`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_dataset_list``
       parameter must be list with a single element (the complete test set).
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_dataset_list`` and
       ``test_dataset_list`` must contain the same amount of datasets.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param eval_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param dataset_type: The type of the dataset. Defaults to None, which
       means that the type will be obtained from the input datasets. If input
       datasets are not instances of :class:`AvalancheDataset`, the type
       UNDEFINED will be used.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.

   This helper function is DEPRECATED in favor of
   `create_generic_benchmark_from_filelists`.

   Creates a generic scenario given a list of filelists and the respective task
   labels. A separate dataset will be created for each filelist and each of
   those training datasets will be considered a separate training experience.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list of filelists for the test
   datsets that must contain the same amount of elements of the training list.
   Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   This helper functions is the best shot when loading Caffe-style dataset
   based on filelists.

   The resulting benchmark instance and the intermediate datasets used to
   populate it will be of type CLASSIFICATION.

   :param root: The root path of the dataset.
   :param train_file_lists: A list of filelists describing the
       paths of the training patterns for each experience.
   :param test_file_lists: A list of filelists describing the
       paths of the test patterns for each experience.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_file_lists`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_file_lists``
       parameter must be list with a single element (the complete test set).
       Alternatively, can be a plain string or :class:`Path` object.
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_file_lists`` and
       ``test_file_lists`` must contain the same amount of filelists paths.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param eval_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.


.. function:: create_generic_scenario_from_paths(train_list_of_files: Sequence[Sequence[FileAndLabel]], test_list_of_files: Union[Sequence[FileAndLabel], Sequence[Sequence[FileAndLabel]]], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, eval_transform=None, eval_target_transform=None, dataset_type: AvalancheDatasetType = AvalancheDatasetType.UNDEFINED) -> GenericCLScenario

   This helper function is DEPRECATED in favor of
   `create_generic_benchmark_from_paths`.

   Creates a generic scenario given a sequence of lists of files. A separate
   dataset will be created for each list. Each of those training datasets
   will be considered a separate training experience.

   This is very similar to `create_generic_scenario_from_filelists`, with the
   main difference being that `create_generic_scenario_from_filelists`
   accepts, for each experience, a file list formatted in Caffe-style.
   On the contrary, this accepts a list of tuples where each tuple contains
   two elements: the full path to the pattern and its label.
   Optionally, the tuple may contain a third element describing the bounding
   box of the element to crop. This last bounding box may be useful when trying
   to extract the part of the image depicting the desired element.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list for the test datasets that
   must contain the same amount of elements of the training list.
   Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   The label of each pattern doesn't have to be an int.

   :param train_list_of_files: A list of lists. Each list describes the paths
       and labels of patterns to include in that training experience, as
       tuples. Each tuple must contain two elements: the full path to the
       pattern and its class label. Optionally, the tuple may contain a
       third element describing the bounding box to use for cropping (top,
       left, height, width).
   :param test_list_of_files: A list of lists. Each list describes the paths
       and labels of patterns to include in that test experience, as tuples.
       Each tuple must contain two elements: the full path to the pattern
       and its class label. Optionally, the tuple may contain a third element
       describing the bounding box to use for cropping (top, left, height,
       width).
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_file_lists`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_list_of_files``
       parameter must define a single experience (the complete test set).
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_list_of_files`` and
       ``test_list_of_files`` must contain the same amount of paths.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param eval_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param dataset_type: The type of the dataset. Defaults to UNDEFINED.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.


.. function:: create_generic_scenario_from_tensor_lists(train_tensors: Sequence[Sequence[Any]], test_tensors: Sequence[Sequence[Any]], task_labels: Sequence[int], *, complete_test_set_only: bool = False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, eval_transform=None, eval_target_transform=None, dataset_type: AvalancheDatasetType = None) -> GenericCLScenario

   This helper function is DEPRECATED in favor of
   `create_generic_benchmark_from_tensor_lists`.

   Creates a generic scenario given lists of Tensors. A separate dataset will
   be created from each Tensor tuple (x, y, z, ...) and each of those training
   datasets will be considered a separate training experience. Using this
   helper function is the lowest-level way to create a Continual Learning
   scenario. When possible, consider using higher level helpers.

   Experiences are defined by passing lists of tensors as the `train_tensors`
   and `test_tensors` parameter. Those parameters must be lists containing
   sub-lists of tensors, one for each experience. Each tensor defines the value
   of a feature ("x", "y", "z", ...) for all patterns of that experience.

   By default the second tensor of each experience will be used to fill the
   `targets` value (label of each pattern).

   In its base form, the test lists must contain the same amount of elements of
   the training lists. Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the
   "past", "cumulative" (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets.
   However, in certain Continual Learning scenarios only the concept of
   "complete" test set makes sense. In that case, the
   ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the parameter
   description for more info).

   :param train_tensors: A list of lists. The first list must contain the
       tensors for the first training experience (one tensor per feature), the
       second list must contain the tensors for the second training experience,
       and so on.
   :param test_tensors: A list of lists. The first list must contain the
       tensors for the first test experience (one tensor per feature), the
       second list must contain the tensors for the second test experience,
       and so on. When using `complete_test_set_only`, this parameter
       must be a list containing a single sub-list for the single test
       experience.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain a task label for
       each experience. For Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free)
       scenarios, this is usually a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario,
       this is usually a list of ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that ``test_tensors`` must
       define a single experience. Defaults to False, which means that
       ``train_tensors`` and ``test_tensors`` must define the same
       amount of experiences.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param eval_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param dataset_type: The type of the dataset. Defaults to None, which
       means that the type will be obtained from the input datasets. If input
       datasets are not instances of :class:`AvalancheDataset`, the type
       UNDEFINED will be used.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.


.. function:: create_generic_scenario_from_tensors(train_data_x: Sequence[Any], train_data_y: Sequence[Sequence[SupportsInt]], test_data_x: Union[Any, Sequence[Any]], test_data_y: Union[Any, Sequence[Sequence[SupportsInt]]], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, eval_transform=None, eval_target_transform=None, dataset_type: AvalancheDatasetType = AvalancheDatasetType.UNDEFINED) -> GenericCLScenario

   This helper function is DEPRECATED in favor of
   `create_generic_benchmark_from_tensor_lists`.

   Please consider using :func:`create_generic_scenario_from_tensor_lists`
   instead. When switching to the new function, please keep in mind that the
   format of the parameters is completely different!

   Creates a generic scenario given lists of Tensors and the respective task
   labels. A separate dataset will be created from each Tensor pair (x + y)
   and each of those training datasets will be considered a separate
   training experience. Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including
   the targets. Using this helper function is the lower level way to create a
   Continual Learning scenario. When possible, consider using higher level
   helpers.

   By default the second tensor of each experience will be used to fill the
   `targets` value (label of each pattern).

   In its base form, the test lists must contain the same amount of elements of
   the training lists. Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the
   "past", "cumulative" (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets.
   However, in certain Continual Learning scenarios only the concept of
   "complete" test set makes sense. In that case, the
   ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the parameter
   description for more info).

   :param train_data_x: A list of Tensors (one per experience) containing the
       patterns of the training sets.
   :param train_data_y: A list of Tensors or int lists containing the
       labels of the patterns of the training sets. Must contain the same
       number of elements of ``train_datasets_x``.
   :param test_data_x: A Tensor or a list of Tensors (one per experience)
       containing the patterns of the test sets.
   :param test_data_y: A Tensor or a list of Tensors or int lists containing
       the labels of the patterns of the test sets. Must contain the same
       number of elements of ``test_datasets_x``.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_datasets_x`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that ``test_data_x`` and
       ``test_data_y`` must define a single experience. Defaults to False,
       which means that ``train_data_*`` and ``test_data_*`` must define the
       same amount of experiences.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations). Defaults to None.
   :param eval_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param dataset_type: The type of the dataset. Defaults to UNDEFINED.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.


.. py:class:: NCScenario(train_dataset: AvalancheDataset, test_dataset: AvalancheDataset, n_experiences: int, task_labels: bool, shuffle: bool = True, seed: Optional[int] = None, fixed_class_order: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None, per_experience_classes: Optional[Dict[int, int]] = None, class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp: bool = False, class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp: bool = False, reproducibility_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None)

   Bases: :class:`GenericCLScenario['NCExperience']`

   This class defines a "New Classes" scenario. Once created, an instance
   of this class can be iterated in order to obtain the experience sequence
   under the form of instances of :class:`NCExperience`.

   This class can be used directly. However, we recommend using facilities like
   :func:`avalanche.benchmarks.generators.nc_benchmark`.

   Creates a ``NCGenericScenario`` instance given the training and test
   Datasets and the number of experiences.

   By default, the number of classes will be automatically detected by
   looking at the training Dataset ``targets`` field. Classes will be
   uniformly distributed across ``n_experiences`` unless a
   ``per_experience_classes`` argument is specified.

   The number of classes must be divisible without remainder by the number
   of experiences. This also applies when the ``per_experience_classes``
   argument is not None.

   :param train_dataset: The training dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``train_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param test_dataset: The test dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``test_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param n_experiences: The number of experiences.
   :param task_labels: If True, each experience will have an ascending task
       label. If False, the task label will be 0 for all the experiences.
   :param shuffle: If True, the class order will be shuffled. Defaults to
       True.
   :param seed: If shuffle is True and seed is not None, the class order
       will be shuffled according to the seed. When None, the current
       PyTorch random number generator state will be used.
       Defaults to None.
   :param fixed_class_order: If not None, the class order to use (overrides
       the shuffle argument). Very useful for enhancing
       reproducibility. Defaults to None.
   :param per_experience_classes: Is not None, a dictionary whose keys are
       (0-indexed) experience IDs and their values are the number of
       classes to include in the respective experiences. The dictionary
       doesn't have to contain a key for each experience! All the remaining
       experiences will contain an equal amount of the remaining classes.
       The remaining number of classes must be divisible without remainder
       by the remaining number of experiences. For instance,
       if you want to include 50 classes in the first experience
       while equally distributing remaining classes across remaining
       experiences, just pass the "{0: 50}" dictionary as the
       per_experience_classes parameter. Defaults to None.
   :param class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp: If True, original class IDs
       will be remapped so that they will appear as having an ascending
       order. For instance, if the resulting class order after shuffling
       (or defined by fixed_class_order) is [23, 34, 11, 7, 6, ...] and
       class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp is True, then all the patterns
       belonging to class 23 will appear as belonging to class "0",
       class "34" will be mapped to "1", class "11" to "2" and so on.
       This is very useful when drawing confusion matrices and when dealing
       with algorithms with dynamic head expansion. Defaults to False.
       Mutually exclusive with the ``class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp``
       parameter.
   :param class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp: If True, original class IDs
       will be mapped to range [0, n_classes_in_exp) for each experience.
       Defaults to False. Mutually exclusive with the
       ``class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp parameter``.
   :param reproducibility_data: If not None, overrides all the other
       scenario definition options. This is usually a dictionary containing
       data used to reproduce a specific experiment. One can use the
       ``get_reproducibility_data`` method to get (and even distribute)
       the experiment setup so that it can be loaded by passing it as this
       parameter. In this way one can be sure that the same specific
       experimental setup is being used (for reproducibility purposes).
       Beware that, in order to reproduce an experiment, the same train and
       test datasets must be used. Defaults to None.

   .. attribute:: classes_order
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      Stores the class order (remapped class IDs). 


   .. attribute:: classes_order_original_ids
      :annotation: :List[int]

      Stores the class order (original class IDs) 


   .. attribute:: class_mapping
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      class_mapping stores the class mapping so that 
      `mapped_class_id = class_mapping[original_class_id]`. 

      If the benchmark is created with an amount of classes which is less than
      the amount of all classes in the dataset, then class_mapping will 
      contain some -1 values corresponding to ignored classes. This can
      happen when passing a fixed class order to the constructor.


   .. attribute:: n_classes_per_exp
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      A list that, for each experience (identified by its index/ID),
      stores the number of classes assigned to that experience. 


   .. attribute:: original_classes_in_exp
      :annotation: :List[Set[int]] = []

      A list that, for each experience (identified by its index/ID), stores a 
      set of the original IDs of classes assigned to that experience. 
      This field applies to both train and test streams.


   .. attribute:: class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp
      :annotation: :bool

      If True the class IDs have been remapped to start from zero. 


   .. attribute:: class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp
      :annotation: :bool

      If True the class IDs have been remapped to start from zero in 
      each experience 


   .. attribute:: n_classes
      :annotation: :int

      The number of classes 


   .. attribute:: train_exps_patterns_assignment
      

      A list containing which training instances are assigned to each
      experience in the train stream. Instances are identified by their id 
      w.r.t. the dataset found in the original_train_dataset field. 


   .. attribute:: test_exps_patterns_assignment
      

      A list containing which test instances are assigned to each
      experience in the test stream. Instances are identified by their id 
      w.r.t. the dataset found in the original_test_dataset field. 


   .. method:: get_reproducibility_data(self)

      Gets the data needed to reproduce this experiment.

      This data can be stored using the pickle module or some other mechanism.
      It can then be loaded by passing it as the ``reproducibility_data``
      parameter in the constructor.

      Child classes should create their own reproducibility dictionary.
      This means that the implementation found in :class:`GenericCLScenario`
      will return an empty dictionary, which is meaningless.

      In order to obtain the same benchmark instance, the reproducibility
      data must be passed to the constructor along with the exact same
      input datasets.

      :return: A dictionary containing the data needed to reproduce the
          experiment.


   .. method:: classes_in_exp_range(self, exp_start: int, exp_end: Optional[int] = None) -> List[int]

      Gets a list of classes contained in the given experiences. The
      experiences are defined by range. This means that only the classes in
      range [exp_start, exp_end) will be included.

      :param exp_start: The starting experience ID.
      :param exp_end: The final experience ID. Can be None, which means that
          all the remaining experiences will be taken.

      :returns: The classes contained in the required experience range.



.. py:class:: NCExperience(origin_stream: GenericScenarioStream['NCExperience', NCScenario], current_experience: int)

   Bases: :class:`GenericExperience[NCScenario, GenericScenarioStream['NCExperience', NCScenario]]`

   Defines a "New Classes" experience. It defines fields to obtain the current
   dataset and the associated task label. It also keeps a reference to the
   stream from which this experience was taken.

   Creates a ``NCExperience`` instance given the stream from this
   experience was taken and and the current experience ID.

   :param origin_stream: The stream from which this experience was
       obtained.
   :param current_experience: The current experience ID, as an integer.


.. py:class:: NIScenario(train_dataset: AvalancheDataset, test_dataset: AvalancheDataset, n_experiences: int, task_labels: bool = False, shuffle: bool = True, seed: Optional[int] = None, balance_experiences: bool = False, min_class_patterns_in_exp: int = 0, fixed_exp_assignment: Optional[Sequence[Sequence[int]]] = None, reproducibility_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None)

   Bases: :class:`GenericCLScenario['NIExperience']`

   This class defines a "New Instance" scenario.
   Once created, an instance of this class can be iterated in order to obtain
   the experience sequence under the form of instances of
   :class:`NIExperience`.

   Instances of this class can be created using the constructor directly.
   However, we recommend using facilities like
   :func:`avalanche.benchmarks.generators.ni_scenario`.

   Consider that every method from :class:`NIExperience` used to retrieve
   parts of the test set (past, current, future, cumulative) always return the
   complete test set. That is, they behave as the getter for the complete test
   set.

   Creates a NIScenario instance given the training and test Datasets and
   the number of experiences.

   :param train_dataset: The training dataset. The dataset must be an
       instance of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``train_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param test_dataset: The test dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``test_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param n_experiences: The number of experiences.
   :param task_labels: If True, each experience will have an ascending task
       label. If False, the task label will be 0 for all the experiences.
       Defaults to False.
   :param shuffle: If True, the patterns order will be shuffled. Defaults
       to True.
   :param seed: If shuffle is True and seed is not None, the class order
       will be shuffled according to the seed. When None, the current
       PyTorch random number generator state will be used.
       Defaults to None.
   :param balance_experiences: If True, pattern of each class will be
       equally spread across all experiences. If False, patterns will be
       assigned to experiences in a complete random way. Defaults to False.
   :param min_class_patterns_in_exp: The minimum amount of patterns of
       every class that must be assigned to every experience. Compatible
       with the ``balance_experiences`` parameter. An exception will be
       raised if this constraint can't be satisfied. Defaults to 0.
   :param fixed_exp_assignment: If not None, the pattern assignment
       to use. It must be a list with an entry for each experience. Each
       entry is a list that contains the indexes of patterns belonging to
       that experience. Overrides the ``shuffle``, ``balance_experiences``
       and ``min_class_patterns_in_exp`` parameters.
   :param reproducibility_data: If not None, overrides all the other
       scenario definition options, including ``fixed_exp_assignment``.
       This is usually a dictionary containing data used to
       reproduce a specific experiment. One can use the
       ``get_reproducibility_data`` method to get (and even distribute)
       the experiment setup so that it can be loaded by passing it as this
       parameter. In this way one can be sure that the same specific
       experimental setup is being used (for reproducibility purposes).
       Beware that, in order to reproduce an experiment, the same train and
       test datasets must be used. Defaults to None.

   .. attribute:: n_classes
      :annotation: :int

      The amount of classes in the original training set.


   .. attribute:: n_patterns_per_class
      :annotation: :List[int]

      The amount of patterns for each class in the original training set.


   .. attribute:: n_patterns_per_experience
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      The number of patterns in each experience.


   .. attribute:: exp_structure
      :annotation: :List[List[int]] = []

      This field contains, for each training experience, the number of
      instances of each class assigned to that experience. 


   .. attribute:: train_exps_patterns_assignment
      

      A list containing which training instances are assigned to each
      experience in the train stream. Instances are identified by their id 
      w.r.t. the dataset found in the original_train_dataset field. 


   .. method:: get_reproducibility_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]

      Gets the data needed to reproduce this experiment.

      This data can be stored using the pickle module or some other mechanism.
      It can then be loaded by passing it as the ``reproducibility_data``
      parameter in the constructor.

      Child classes should create their own reproducibility dictionary.
      This means that the implementation found in :class:`GenericCLScenario`
      will return an empty dictionary, which is meaningless.

      In order to obtain the same benchmark instance, the reproducibility
      data must be passed to the constructor along with the exact same
      input datasets.

      :return: A dictionary containing the data needed to reproduce the
          experiment.



.. py:class:: NIExperience(origin_stream: GenericScenarioStream['NIExperience', NIScenario], current_experience: int)

   Bases: :class:`GenericExperience[NIScenario, GenericScenarioStream['NIExperience', NIScenario]]`

   Defines a "New Instances" experience. It defines fields to obtain the
   current dataset and the associated task label. It also keeps a reference
   to the stream from which this experience was taken.

   Creates a ``NIExperience`` instance given the stream from this
   experience was taken and and the current experience ID.

   :param origin_stream: The stream from which this experience was
       obtained.
   :param current_experience: The current experience ID, as an integer.
